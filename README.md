Linear Regression EDA Project

Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand the relationships between variables and how they can be used to predict a target variable using Linear Regression. The primary objective of this project is to clean the data, explore patterns, and build a linear regression model to predict the target variable.

Objectives

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the structure and relationships in the data.
Feature Selection: Identify key features for predicting the target variable.
Modeling: Implement a Linear Regression model.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like R² and RMSE.

Steps Involved

1. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing data by either removing or imputing missing values.
Treat outliers using methods like z-score or IQR.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Normalize or scale numerical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
Univariate Analysis: Explore individual features using histograms, box plots, and distribution plots.
Bivariate Analysis: Analyze relationships between features and the target variable using scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.
Feature Correlation: Understand the correlation between features and their impact on the target variable.
Key EDA Insights
Significant trends and patterns in the data.
Correlations that helped in feature selection.

3. Model Building: Linear Regression
   
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Fit a Linear Regression model using the training set.
Use the model to predict the target variable on the test set.

4. Model Evaluation
   
R-squared (R²): Explains how well the regression model fits the data.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the difference between predicted and actual values.
Other relevant metrics as needed for your specific dataset.

Results

Discuss the model performance and accuracy.
Highlight any improvements that were made after tuning the model.
Mention areas for future improvement or further analysis.

Technologies Used

Python: For data analysis and model building.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical calculations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building the linear regression model and evaluation.

Conclusion

Summarize key takeaways from the analysis and the effectiveness of linear regression on the dataset. Discuss any challenges faced during the project and potential ways to improve the model in future iterations.
